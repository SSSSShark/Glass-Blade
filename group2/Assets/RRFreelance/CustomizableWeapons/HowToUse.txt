Customisable Weapons Shader.

This requires your mesh to have Vertex Color data, by default, this is white and very rarely used. Most game engines will have a texture 
that obtains the colour information, this shader taps into both. You supply a light-greyscale version of your texture as well as the
original diffuse colour texture and let the shader do the rest.

It can support up to 6 unique color changes, for this, you will need to fill in your polys with one of the pure colours.
Red (255,0,0) (R) Col1
Green (0,255,0) (G) Col2
Blue (0,0,255) (B) Col3
Cyan (0,255,255) (C) Col4
Magenta (255,0,255) (M) Col5
Yellow (255,255,0) (Y) Col6

You also have control over the Metalness and Glossiness of each part.

There are sliders for the amount of the original color versus the replacing colours you want to see, as well as how they mix.
There is also a Debug vertex color slider at the bottom, move it to the right to visualise these, then slide back to 0 when you are done.

The Weapons supplied have this done already using 3DsMax's Vertex Paint Modifier, you can also do this in Maya or Blender. Simply search
for vertex coloring and there should be an abundance of tutorials that will suit your needs.

We plan on making more assets for this pack including guns and other mellee weapons that also make use of the vertex color feature. 
There is also plans to make a color ID texture version of the shader that instead of using the vertex color, it can be driven from a
colour ID texture, the means more accuracy. Anything else you'd like to see, simply get in touch.
